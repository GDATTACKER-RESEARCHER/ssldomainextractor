# ssldomainextractor
This script extracts domains from SSL certificates for a provided domain list without using third-party services. It connects directly, retrieves SSL certificates, and extracts associated domains. It supports custom resolvers, user agents, and concurrent processing. Results are saved in separate files for wildcard and non-wildcard domains.
